# Converge voice and writing rules

This project is technical and it’s opinionated. The docs should read like engineering, not marketing.

## Rules

1. Don’t use Oxford commas in Converge prose.
2. Don’t use em dashes. Use parentheses or split the sentence.
3. Prefer short sentences and active voice.
4. Use contractions where they fit. Keep the cadence human.
5. Avoid hype words like revolutionary game changing or unbeatable.
6. Never claim support for a backend that doesn’t exist yet.
7. Don’t name drop people in core docs. The work should stand on its own.
8. Be specific. If it’s a target say it’s planned. If it exists say how to run it.

## Tone target

We write with conviction and receipts. We can be blunt. We can’t be vague.
